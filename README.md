This report outlines the design choices, responsive design implementation, and challenges faced during the creation of a business-themed webpage using Bootstrap.
The color scheme was customized using CSS variables to create a cohesive and visually appealing theme, including dark blue and complementary colors. The sections include a navigation bar, hero section, missions, gallery, contact form, and footer, each contributing to an engaging user experience.
Bootstrap's grid system was used extensively to ensure responsiveness across various devices. The container, row, and column classes helped create a flexible layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. The navigation bar used the `.navbar-toggler` button for a collapsible menu on smaller screens, while the hero and content sections utilized Bootstrap's utility classes for alignment and spacing. The gallery and project sections used Bootstrap's grid system to maintain a clean layout on all devices.
The project provided valuable experience in using Bootstrap to create a responsive webpage. Customizing the theme and implementing Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes resulted in a visually engaging website. The challenges faced offered insights into balancing design and functionality, enhancing the overall user experience.
